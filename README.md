# vehicle-Recognition-using-deep-learning-algorithm-
vehicle recognition using YOLO-V3

## in this project,in summary,first we use vehicle image dataset about ~18000 iamges,in 123 various classes,and lebel them then we train our dataset with YOLO-V3 Object Detection model,and test model with our weights,we found that due to imbalance dataset (is not equal number of images in our classes),we get ~0.6 accuracy in our traiing dataset,so we try that by decreasing the imbalance dataset and decrease our classes to 35 vehicle model,approximately,we get ~0.8 accuracy by balancing dataset,the summary of our result is documented in this github repo.
